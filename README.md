## browser-sync setup ##
### basic webapp ###

* `npm install`
* `npm run start`

if you decide to use this example for your project, and you need more than just a basic webpage, or you want to use a different folder structure:
you'll need to edit the `browser_sync_config.js` file. It's commented to make it easier to understand how it works.
Basically just add and edit paths so that browser-sync will watch the files that you need it to watch. Also you may want to go to the bottom of the file and change the path that the server is using.
